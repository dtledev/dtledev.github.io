I like to tinker with tech and always had an interest in pushing the potential of older computers. I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to share share my experiences, side projects in tech that I\u0026rsquo;ve found fun and interesting. Although I\u0026rsquo;ve created pages for internal clients during my day job, it is nice to build something that will be long living and share. The influence for this page also comes from the Cloud Resume challenge by Forrest Brazeal. Aside from sharing my findings but also sharing as documentation for my current setups. My first set of posts will focus on the upgrades to my home lab infrastructure setup and current learnings.\nThanks for reading and enjoy the rest of your day ","date":"12 March 2024","permalink":"/posts/2024-03-12-first-post/","section":"Posts","summary":"Learn more about me and why I am starting this blog.","title":"My First Blog Post"},{"content":"","date":"12 March 2024","permalink":"/tags/new/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"new"},{"content":"","date":"12 March 2024","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":"12 March 2024","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 March 2024","permalink":"/tags/welcome/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"welcome"},{"content":" Hi there, I\u0026rsquo;m Daniel 👋 # I\u0026rsquo;m an engineer located in Toronto, Canada and I work specifically in the field of platform engineering and cloud infrastructure.\nI always loved working with electronics and tweaking my PC for optimal performance as a hobby and this led me to a career focusing on networking, infrastructure and development.
