            </div>Motivation Years ago I ran VMWare vSphere on as a VM my desktop gaming PC. It worked but it used a lot of resources and became tedious to switch whenever I wanted to do something else or startup a game. In the past few years I had embraced the cloud as I started to use it for work diving deep into AWS in my day job. In the past few years WSL and Docker Desktop saw more maturity so on Windows I no longer saw the need to run a seperate linux VM]]></description>

Between then and now
Why a static website Why static websit

            </div>Intro This is a personal page that I created to try my hand at blogging and technical writing. I like to tinker with tech and always had an interest in pushing the potential of older computers. I&rsquo;m hoping to share share my experiences, side projects in tech that I&rsquo;ve found fun and interesting.
Although I&rsquo;ve created pages for internal clients during my day job, it is nice to build something to share.]]></description>
