            </div>When starting a blog
Last time I truly hosted a public site was in the early 2010s when learning about the new trend of responsive web design with the growth of mobile web browsing.

            </div>Hi there, I&rsquo;m Daniel ðŸ‘‹ About I&rsquo;m an engineer located in Toronto, Canada and I work specifically in the field of platform engineering and cloud infrastructure.
I always loved working with electronics and tweaking my PC for optimal performance as a hobby and this led me to a career focusing on networking, infrastructure and development. The idea of learning in public peaked my interest since I&rsquo;ve always been dabbling and trying new things and taking notes so this helps to formalize and share them.]]></description>

            </div>Intro This is a personal page that I created to try my hand at blogging and technical writing. I like to tinker with tech and always had an interest in pushing the potential of older computers. I&rsquo;m hoping to share share my experiences, side projects in tech that I&rsquo;ve found fun and interesting.
Although I&rsquo;ve created pages for internal clients during my day job, it is nice to build something to share.]]></description>
