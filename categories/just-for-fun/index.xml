      <description>Intro This is a personal page that I created to try my hand at blogging and technical writing. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to share share my experiences, side projects in tech that I&amp;rsquo;ve found fun and interesting. Aside from sharing my findings but also serve as documentation
My first set of posts will focus on the upgrades to my home lab infrastructure setup and current learnings.
The influence for this page comes from the Cloud Resume challenge, although I&amp;rsquo;ve created pages for internal clients during my day job.</description>
